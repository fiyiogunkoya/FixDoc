# Scenario 15: No-Op Plan
#
# A full apply followed by an immediate re-plan. All resources show "no-op"
# or "read" actions in the second plan, with nothing actionable.
#
# Expected change impact behavior:
#   - is_actionable_change() returns False for all nodes → score = 0
#   - resource_warnings = [] (no actionable changed resources)
#   - severity = "low"
#
# Includes a data source (data "aws_caller_identity") to confirm "read"
# actions are also filtered correctly.
#
# Run with: run_apply_then_plan_noop (apply → plan with no changes)
